# E-Voting-System-Using-Blockchain
It is an electronic voting system for college-level student council elections, aiming to create
a user-friendly and secure platform.
Utilizing blockchain technology, the system ensures high security and provides a key feature
of unlinkabilityâ€”meaning even the admin cannot see who voted for whom.
This level of security and anonymity was achieved through the innovative use of blockchain.
